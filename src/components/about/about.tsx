        <p>
          Iâ€™m a 19 year old self taught{" "}
          <span className="thick__text">Frontend Developer</span>. I found my
          passion in coding after discovering my brother doing it.
          <br />
          <br />I fell in love with the craft of being able to use my creativity
          to build stuff for the web. What kept me on this journey is that I
          found it exciting to always learn new things and challenges that I'm
          not familiar with.
          <br />

            If I'm not doing anything coding related
          </span>
          , I enjoy spending time with my family and working out.
